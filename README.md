# Suicide Rate Analysis

Data mining - Suicide rate analysis

The topic I chose for graph analysis is Suicide rate. This analysis is carried out by comparing socio-economic info with suicide rates by year and country.

## About the dataset:
I got the dataset from Kaggle. I gave the link below for reference.
This dataset is basically a compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets. These 4 datasets are linked by time and place. This dataset is built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally across the socio-economic spectrum.
